# SNAKE
## A modern day recreation

Snake is a classic game, introduced all the way back in *1997*. As most true classics, it was originally conceived in the language of C.

While that was one of the more powerful languages in its day, that is no longer the case. Today we can make this classic game using basic HTML, CSS, and Java.. Script.

### Mechanics :
Really? You have no idea what the controls could possibly be? Unbelievable ðŸ™„.

Well if I have to spell it out for you.

Want to go left? Left arrow.

Want to go right? Right arrow.

Want to go up? Up arrow.

Want to go down? Down arrow.

If you're going right, you can't go left.

If you're going up, you can't go down.

Vice versa for both.

Don't run into the wall.

Don't eat yourself.

Stay safe kids, and don't forget to wear protection!
